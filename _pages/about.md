I am a Ph.D. student in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/) at MIT, advised by [Prof. Sertac Karaman](https://aera.mit.edu/).
Previously, I obtained my BS degree from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ee.snu.ac.kr/en) at [Seoul National University (SNU)](https://en.snu.ac.kr/).

My research interests include motion planning and machine learning algorithm for robotic platforms. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
